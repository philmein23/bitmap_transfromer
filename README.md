# bitmap-transformer

I worked on the bitmap transformer project with Greg Madgsick, Shelly Y, James Norton, and Rachel Burke.

For this assignment you will be building a Bitmap reader and transformer. It will read a Bitmap in from disk, run one or more color transforms on the bitmap and then write it out to a new file. This project will require the use of node buffers in order to manipulate binary data. Your project should include tests, as well as a Gulpfile and package.json file. Make sure to run all your code through jshint or eslint. 

To use this application, type in "node index.js" and it will transform (invert) the bitmap resulting in a new file located in the img folder.
